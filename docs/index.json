We are next going to update the camera\u0026rsquo;s firmware to run telnetd upon booting up, allowing us to connect to it remotely.\nDump Firmware The first step in enabling remote connections is to dump the camera\u0026rsquo;s firmware.\nYou may notice that, though we have shell, basic commands like whoami seem to give errors\n/ # whoami whoami: unknown uid 0 This is because we bypassed the initialization scripts that would mount file systems and start and configure certain services.\nWe could simply run /init but the camera\u0026rsquo;s services all output to stdout which make it nearly impossible to use the shell. Thankfully, the services will log to a specific file if it exists when they are run.\nRun the following to ensure the services will only log to a file\n/ # mount /mnt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir /mnt/debug \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch /mnt/debug/log.txt Where,\n mount /mnt: Mounts the /mnt directory according to the /etc/fstab file mkdir /mnt/debug \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch /mnt/debug/log.txt: Creates the debug directory and the log file the services will log to  Now we can safely run the initialization scripts. The scripts output to the console then start executing services in the background, dropping you back in the shell\n/ # /etc/init.d/rcS mount all file system... mount: according to /proc/mounts, tmpfs is already mounted on /mnt starting mdev... ************************** Love Linux ! ! ! ************************** 200+0 records in 200+0 records out 102400 bytes (100.0KB) copied, 0.024803 seconds, 3.9MB/s find: insmod: No such file or directory aksensor_module_init aksensor 0-0001: Sensor ID error Running whoami shows us that the system has been initialized\n~ # whoami root Because we will be connecting remotely later on, lets update root\u0026rsquo;s password to something we know\n~ # passwd Changing password for root New password: Bad password: too short Retype password: Password for root changed by root Note: For the purpose of this guide, a simple password was used. It is advised to use a stronger password to avoid being easily compromised.\nConnect the micro SD card to the camera and run the following:\n~ # mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt ~ # mkdir /mnt/firmware ~ # cp /dev/mtdblock* /mnt/firmware/ Where,\n mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt: Mounts the micro SD card to /mnt cp /dev/mtdblock* /mnt/firmware/: Copies the block devices that contain the firmware over to the micro SD card  Modify firmware The block device that we need to modify is just a squashfs filesystem file. To extract the files from the firmware, lets install the squashfs tools\nsudo apt install squashfs-tools Now connect the micro SD to the computer and mount the card\nkali@kali:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/pc420 kali@kali:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/pc420 Now run the following to unsquash the root filesystem:\nkali@kali:~$ unsquashfs -d rootfs /mnt/pc420/firmware/mtdblock4 Parallel unsquashfs: Using 6 processors 320 inodes (338 blocks) to write [===================-] 338/338 100% created 302 files created 17 directories created 18 symlinks created 0 devices created 0 fifos created 0 sockets Where,\n unsquashfs -d rootfs /mnt/pc420/firmware/mtdblock4: Unsquashes the mtdblock4 squashfs file and extracts the files to the rootfs directory  Now we are going to update the initialization scripts to start telnet and ftp upon boot. Edit rootfs/etc/init.d/rcS and uncomment lines 7 and 8\necho \u0026quot;start telnet......\u0026quot; telnetd \u0026amp; Edit rootfs/etc/init.d/rc.local and uncomment line 13\n/bin/tcpsvd 0 21 ftpd -w / -t 600 \u0026amp; Build firmware Now that we have modified the initialization scripts, we are going to \u0026lsquo;resquash\u0026rsquo; the files\nkali@kali:~$ mksquashfs rootfs /mnt/pc420/root.sqsh4 -comp xz Where,\n rootfs: The path to the directory containing the filesystem /mnt/pc420/root.sqsh4: The destination of the resulting squashfs file -comp xz: Compress the filesystem using xz  Once complete, unmount the micro SD card\nkali@kali:~$ sudo umount /mnt/pc420 Update camera firmware Now that we have the modified squashfs file, we can update the camera\u0026rsquo;s firmware. Plug the micro SD into the camera and run the following\n~ # mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt ~ # /usr/sbin/update.sh Where,\n mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt: Mounts the micro SD card to /mnt /usr/sbin/update.sh: Runs the script to update the camera\u0026rsquo;s firmware  The camera should reboot once it is done updating.\nConnect camera to WiFi Now that the firmware has been updated, we no longer need to boot to /bin/sh. To change the bootargs, follow the steps taken in the UART to U-Boot section to get into the U-Boot shell and run the following:\nanyka$ setenv bootargs console=ttySAK0,115200n8 root=/dev/mtdblock4 rootfstype=squashfs init=/init mem=64M memsize=64M anyka$ saveenv Saving Environment to SPI Flash... Env save done OK Now disconnect and re connect the power to the camera. The camera should not boot into a shell but should run our modified initialization scripts.\nWe now need to connect the camera to the WiFi. The first step to do this is to connect the computer to the WiFi the camera is broadcasting. The camera\u0026rsquo;s WiFi SSID should start with \u0026lsquo;Victure_\u0026rsquo;.\nOnce connected, run the following on the computer, replacing PASSWORD and SSID with the password and SSID of the WiFi it should connect to:\nqrcode_header='\\x68\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x80' victure_user=\u0026quot;95c992cdf31fc7d0\u0026quot; timezone=\u0026quot;-7.00\u0026quot; region=\u0026quot;US\u0026quot; wifi_type=\u0026quot;WPA\u0026quot; wifi_password='PASSWORD' wifi_ssid='SSID' payload=\u0026quot;WIFI:U:$victure_user;Z:$timezone;R:$region;T:$wifi_type;P:\\\u0026quot;$wifi_password\\\u0026quot;;S:$wifi_ssid;\u0026quot; ssidLength=\u0026quot;${#wifi_ssid}\u0026quot; passwordLength=\u0026quot;${#wifi_password}\u0026quot; payloadLength=\u0026quot;${#payload}\u0026quot; lengths=\u0026quot;$passwordLength;$ssidLength;$payloadLength\u0026quot; echo -en \u0026quot;${qrcode_header}L:$lengths;$payload\u0026quot; | nc -v 10.1.8.1 6666 This sends the camera all of the info it needs in order to connect to the WiFi. Once done, you should see output in the screen session related to the camera connecting to the WiFi. Make note of the IP that is displayed once it has connected to the WiFi.\nSending select for 192.168.4.46...
