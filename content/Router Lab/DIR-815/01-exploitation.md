Run nmap to discover that port 8080 is open:
```
$ nmap 172.21.0.23 -Pn
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-19 13:20 MDT

## Command Injection

The DIR 815 is vulnerable to command injection. However you need to be authenticated. Login using the credentials:
```

Navigate to `Tools` > `System Check`:

Send the request to the repeater tab.
