### Additional Notes

For this challenge, I actually manually extracted and placed the user.dat file so the challenge would be at an easier level. That being said, the attacker could test downloading different files and if they found an unencrypted backup, which was generated natively via configuring the router, they would have the same end result. Maybe a good challenge for next year.
