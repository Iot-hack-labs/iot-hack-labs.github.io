### BTLE CTF
## About

This lab walks through some tools that are used for hacking Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our target is a Bluetooth CTF project designed to allow users to learn about core concepts of Bluetooth client and server interactions.

## Tips for this lab

⚠️⚠️⚠️ BLE devices are finicky. Here are some helpful tips for this lab:
1. Run commands multiple times if you get errors.
2. Remove and re insert the Bluetooth dongle.
3. Most of the time you can skip ahead in the lab if it just isn't working.
